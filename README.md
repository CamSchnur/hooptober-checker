"Hooptober" is a yearly horror movie watch challenge on the movie website <a href="https://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a>.

This project is a validator for users' individual "Hooptober" lists to see if they adhere to the Hooptober Challenge rules, laid out <a href=https://letterboxd.com/cinemonster/list/hooptober-x-hooptober-hooptober-let-satan/>here</a>.
